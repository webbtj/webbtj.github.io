## Overview

cm-cli is built on top of wp-cli, the WordPress command line interface. The
purpose was to extend the base functionality to allow my team and I to automate
the repetitive parts of a custom WordPress build to let us focus on custom
features and/or get the work rolled out that much faster.

## The Solution

cm-cli adds a bunch of extra tools to do things like create and register menus,
custom post types, custom taxonomies, custom image sizes, etc.
[The documentation](https://github.com/webbtj/cm-cli) has plenty of examples.
