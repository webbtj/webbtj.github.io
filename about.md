Hi, I'm TJ Webb, and I'm a web developer in Nova Scotia. My focus of the last
couple of years has shifted from churning out quality production for client work
to churning out tools that help myself and my teammates roll out quality
production for client work much faster. I've also had a focus on larger web
application style development as of late as opposed to traditional,
structured-content type sites.

This will be a place to keep up with all of my latest projects and blog posts.
My hope is that you'll learn something here or find a new tool to improve your
own workflow. All of my projects are open source and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/webbtj/). I'm most active there and on Twitter
[@webbtj](https://twitter.com/webbtj).

If by some strange happenstance you happen to be looking for a musician from
Nova Scotia you're actually not too far off. I'm a developer & programmer by day
and indie musician by night/weekend. If you were looking for my music and Google
tossed you here, you'd probably be better off at [webb.tj](http://webb.tj).
